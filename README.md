# 8-Puzzle-Problem

Python Code to Solve the 8-Puzzle-Problem

## Description

This code uses BFS to traverse nodes and locates the goal node. It stops searching once the goal node is reched and begins backtracking. The backtracking is used to find the optimal path to be taken after BFS has been implemented.

## Getting Started
* Enter your start node in main() by replacing the value assigned to "Node_State_I"
* Enter your goal node in main() by replacing the value assigned to "Goal_Node"
### Dependencies

* numpy library, python version 3.X.X needed before installing program.

### Installing

* Download the zip file \ pull all files and extract into any workspace as the code is self-contained and does not require any particular environment. 

### Executing program

* Open your IDE in the parent folder of plot_path.py
* Open your text editor and ensure the python interpreter is at least python version 3.X.X and run the below comand (for VSC) or run the file
